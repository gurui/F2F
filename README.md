一个为“面对面”交流服务的手机应用支持平台<br />
A <B>F</B>ace-to-<B>F</B>ace communication supporting platform for mobile<br />
<br />
手机很好，但它不应成为人们面对面交流的工具。手机只是一种工具，我们致力于设计和开发一套还原手机“工具”本质的软件平台。<br/>
Mobile is good, but it should not prevent people from communicating face-to-face. Mobile is a tool, it may be used to <B>enhance</B> face-to-face communication. We are doveting ourself to restoring the "tool" to its original meaning and functionality.<br />

热情期待您的参与!<br />
